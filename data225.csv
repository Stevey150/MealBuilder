Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.
Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into Â½""-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.
Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and Â½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.
Add bread, apples, oil, and Â¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.
Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.
Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425Â°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155Â°F, 50â€“60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165Â°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.
Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.
Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.
Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about Â¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6â€“8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.

Parmesan, finely grated', '4 oz. country-style bread, torn into (1Â½"") pieces', '2 romaine hearts, leaves separated, torn']","Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 450Â°F. Whisk anchovies, garlic, 3 Tbsp. mayonnaise, 1 Tbsp. mustard, 1 Tbsp. oil, and 1Â½ tsp. pepper in a small bowl. Set aside 1 Tbsp. anchovy mayo in another small bowl.
Pat chicken dry; season outside and inside all over with salt. Arrange breast side up in a cast-iron skillet and tuck wings underneath. Arrange shallots around (if using legs, nestle under and around); season with salt and pepper. Brush remaining anchovy mayo all over chicken, making sure to get it into the nooks and crannies, then brush shallots with any leftover anchovy mayo.
Place chicken in oven so legs are facing toward the back (this is the hottest part of the oven and will help the legs cook before the breast dries out) and roast until some anchovy mayo and fat begin to drip onto shallots, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and, using tongs, turn shallots to coat in drippings. Return skillet to oven and continue to roast chicken, stirring shallots once or twice, until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155Â°F, 45â€“55 minutes. If skin starts to get too dark on the top before chicken is done, tent area with foil, leaving the rest of the bird exposed. If using chicken legs, start checking at 40 minutes (a thermometer inserted right at the joint should register 160Â°F). Transfer chicken and shallots to a cutting board, leaving behind any juices and fat in skillet. If shallots need more time to soften and darken, roast a bit longer without chicken before proceeding. Reserve skillet.
Reduce oven temperature to 400Â°F. Finely grate half of zest of 1 lemon into a large bowl; cut lemon in half and squeeze in juice.

Bring the water to a boil, then drain. Repeat this process two more times (blanching the orange zest removes any bitter flavors). Place the ginger and orange zest in a jar or heatproof container. In a saucepan, bring the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, and Â¾ teaspoon salt to a boil. Pour over the ginger and orange. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight. The pickled ginger can be refrigerated for a couple of months.
Drain the pickled ginger and orange and save 3 tablespoons of the pickling liquid. Add both to a blender or mini food processor, along with the olive oil, chile, and remaining 2 tablespoons salt.

Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Place the beets in a baking dish (if using a mix of red and golden beets, separate them into two smaller dishes and divide the oil, vinegar, and water between the two dishes). Drizzle with the oil and add the water and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with foil and roast until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife; this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the thickness of the beets. Let the beets cool, then peel and cut into 1-inch wedges. Place each color of beet, along with any accumulated juices, into a small mixing bowl.
In a skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the cashews and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl.
Pour 1 inch of oil into a small saucepan and add the sunchokes (there should be just enough oil to cover the sunchokes; add more oil if needed). Turn the heat to medium and stir occasionally; when the sunchokes begin to sizzle and foam, increase the temperature to high and continue frying, stirring constantly, until the sunchokes are light golden brown. At this point the sunchokes will rapidly go from golden brown to burnt, so quickly transfer the chips to paper towels to drain. Lightly season with salt. The sunchoke chips can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two, or until they start to soften. (Makes about Â½ cup.)

Butter a 9-inch nonstick metal cake pan with some ghee.
In a large bowl, stir together the paneer, confectionersâ€™ sugar, and cardamom until incorporated but still slightly chunky. Add the semolina, ghee, and milk and whisk until smooth. Stir in the cashews and raisins and set aside.
Sprinkle the granulated sugar over the bottom of the prepared cake pan. Set the pan on the stove over medium heat and once the sugar just begins to bubble and turn pale golden brown (the sugar will continue to caramelize in the oven, so donâ€™t let it get any darker right now), after 8 to 10 minutes, remove the pan from the heat using tongs. (This step is a bit tricky and you might be tempted to move the sugar around with a spoon while it is bubbling, but donâ€™t touch itâ€”just let it caramelize on its own.) You will know itâ€™s ready for the cake batter when itâ€™s bubbling but is still slightly grainy and just turning a pale golden color. Pour the batter into the pan, using a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl clean. It should settle into an even layer on its own, but if it doesnâ€™t, use the spatula to create a smooth surface.
Wearing oven mitts, carefully transfer the pan to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool in the pan to room temperature. Run a paring knife around the cakeâ€™s edges and then place a serving platter larger than the diameter of the cake over the cake and gently flip the cake overâ€”it should slide out, with caramel coming out with it like you would see in a flan (though some caramel will be left in the panâ€”this is fine).
Slice and serve with freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds, if desired. The cake will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Using a wooden spoon, stir frequently during the heating process to prevent the milk from scalding. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan when you stir because this is where the milk is most prone to sticking. The milk will become foamy and bubbles will form on its surface once it reaches the desired temperature.
Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice until evenly distributed, which will cause the separation of curds from the whey. The process should begin right away, but donâ€™t fret if it takes a minute or two. Cover the pan and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes to let the acid work its magic. Check the mixture at this point: It should be slightly yellow and the curds should have completely separated from the whey. Donâ€™t panic if this hasnâ€™t happened completely yet. Simply add another teaspoon of acid and set aside for a few minutes more. This should do the trick.
Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and set the sieve over a bowl. Ladle the curds and whey into the sieve. Reserve the whey for another use. Season the curds (still in the sieve) with salt, stirring it in using a wooden spoon, then gather up the edges of the cheesecloth into a tight bundle and squeeze the excess whey from the curds. Place the cheesecloth and curds on a large plate and shape them into a square. Wrap the cheesecloth edges around the paneer and place a second plate on top of it to compress it.

Combine the carrot, tomatoes plus their juice, and 1 cup water in a blender. Blitz till itâ€™s as smooth as your blender allows.
In an ovenproof 12-inch sautÃ© pan or skillet set over medium heat, cook 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the minced garlic. Watch for the garlic to start sizzling, then stir in the spinach and Â½ teaspoon of the salt. Continue stirring for a minute, until all the spinach is wilted. Remove it from the pan and set aside.
Add the final tablespoon olive oil to the pan, raise the heat to medium, and add the turkey plus 1 teaspoon salt. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, break the turkey up into small morsels as it browns.

Once your onions are sliced, heat your skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil, then the onions and the salt. Let the onions sizzle for a couple minutes.

Give the onions a stir every now and then. You donâ€™t have to stand over it like risotto, but donâ€™t go for a walk around the block either. Caramelized bits will accumulate at the bottom and sides of the pan, and thatâ€™s good. Just scrape them up and stir them in. A little color building as you go is okay, but donâ€™t rush to brown them. The point is to cook the onions gently, coaxing them through stages of raw, wilted, sweaty, soft, light brown, and finally deeply caramelized
About 45 minutes in, remove the lid for the last time. They should be a light caramel color. Now, with the lid off, you will need to watch more closely and stir more frequently. At some point you may find that despite your best efforts some of the caramelized bits, verging on burnt, cling to the pan and threaten over all onion ruin. Do not fret! Just add a Â½ cup or so of water and use its energy to help scrape up the stubborn but tasty film. Let the water cook out of course. When youâ€™re smiling over a soft, creamy, fragrant pile of mahogany onions, youâ€™re done.

Note: Pigeon peas are traditional in this dish, but pinto beans or black-eyes peas also work well because, like pigeon peas, they hold their shape well after cooking. Brown sugar is preferable for deeper flavor and color. Chicken is the most common meat in pelau, but cuts of stew beef or lamb work just as well. If using meat, up the cooking time before adding the rice to 40 minutes to allow the meat to get tender. In Tobago, pelau is often made with crab.

Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant, dry, and toasty. Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter wonâ€™t look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.
Decrease the oven temperature to 350Â°F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Generally, if the entirety of the custard is fully set, your cheesecake is overbaked. Donâ€™t panicâ€”itâ€™ll still be delicious, and youâ€™ll do better next time!
Let the cheesecake cool in the water until it is about room temperature. (You donâ€™t want to have to try to grab the pan out of hot water if you can help it.) However, if youâ€™re worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked, youâ€™ll want to pull it out rather quickly, and let it cool at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. The cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days.
In a large heavy-bottomed sautÃ© pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat.

Add about a fourth of Â¾ cup warm water (110Â°) and mix in a wide circular motion with your fingers to gently combine (do not knead). As mixture becomes dry, add more of the water, little by little, and keep mixing gently until a shaggy dough forms; it should be soft and sticky, without dry spots. (Depending on the humidity, you may not need all of the water.)
Drizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over dough and gently press with your knuckles so that the top of dough is covered with oil. Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest in a warm spot 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix shortening and ghee in a small bowl until smooth.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands and gently fold dough over on itself once or twice, then roll into a fat cylinder. Working quickly, without handling the dough too much, divide dough into four equal pieces and gently form each piece into a ball. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes.
Roll out a dough ball on a lightly floured surface into a 5-6""â€“diameter round. Brush with a quarter of shortening mixture and sprinkle evenly with flour. Cut a slit halfway across the dough, from the center to the edge. Starting on one side of slit, fold cut edge of dough at about a Â¾"" interval. Continue folding process until you reach the other side of the slit and have formed a cone. Pinch together edges at wide end of cone to seal, then bring both point ends together at the top and gently push in toward center of cone to create a dimple (you donâ€™t need to push in too far). Push point at narrow end of cone in toward the center. You should now have a ball with a dimple on each end. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and repeat with remaining balls of dough. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 20 minutes.
Heat a tawa or griddle over medium until a drop of water immediately sizzles on surface, about 2 minutes.

Brush surface of roti with oil and continue to cook until bubbles across surface increase and roti is stiff enough on bottom side to turn, about 1 minute more. Turn roti over and brush surface with oil (bubbles may deflate; thatâ€™s okay).

Swirl 1 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot to coat and heat over medium-high. Place 2 chicken legs, skin side down, in pot, making sure skin is in direct contact with pan. Cook, undisturbed, until dark golden, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden on other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining 2 chicken legs; reserve pot.
Meanwhile, working one at a time, stand a bulb, root end down, on a cutting board and slice off a short end to create a flat surface. Turn cut side down and slice Â½"" thick, starting from the top end of bulb so the root end can hold the layers in place while you slice.

46,Pita,"['1Â½ cups warm water', '1 teaspoon instant yeast', '4Â½ cups (540 grams) bread flour, divided, plus more as needed', '2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for your bowl', '3Â½ teaspoons Morton kosher salt']","Combine the water and yeast in a large mixing bowl (if you have a stand mixer, use that bowl) and let sit for 5 minutes.
Reserve Â½ cup (60 grams) bread flour and add the remaining 4 cups to the mixing bowl along with the canola oil.
If you have a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook and knead the mixture on low speed for about 3 minutes, until a sticky but cohesive dough starts to form. Pause occasionally to scrape down the bowl if the flour is clinging to the sides and bottom or climbing up the hook. If youâ€™re making the dough without a stand mixer, mix it with a wooden spoon. In either case, loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
With your stand mixer on low or while stirring by hand in the mixing bowl, add the salt and, over the course of 2 or 3 minutes, add the remaining Â½ cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time. The dough should be more tense; it will feel soft but tacky, although it will pull from the sides of the bowl.
Flour your hands generously and use them to pull the dough onto a clean, unfloured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough, rolling it in short, circular strokes and using the sides of your hands to nudge it into a relatively smooth ball.
Lightly wipe the inside of a large bowl with canola oil and place the dough inside, flipping it once or twice to coat. Loosely cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 hour.
After 1 hour, the dough will be stretchy but very soft. Leaving it inside the bowl, stretch opposite sides of the dough over the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter- turn and stretch the dough in the same way, then flip the whole mound of dough upside down and cover again. Let rise for 1 hour.
Repeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, itâ€™s ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once itâ€™s shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead.
Wipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you donâ€™t deflate all the air inside.
Lightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of â€œcageâ€ around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball.
Space the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesnâ€™t dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until theyâ€™re pillowy.
Meanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. Youâ€™re emulating a 700Â°F wood- burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake.
When the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you donâ€™t manhandle it or youâ€™ll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin.
With firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter- turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until itâ€™s about 6 inches across.
This next part happens fast and furiously, so make sure you have no distractionsâ€”screaming children and natural disasters will have to wait. Use tongs or a good oven mitt to pull the oven rack with the baking stone partially out. Carefully pick up the pita, drape it over your palm, and slap it down onto the stone as if youâ€™re giving it a high- five (just be careful not to touch the hot stone!). Set a timer for 1 minute, and close the oven. Broilers vary in strength but all are quite hot, so donâ€™t turn your back on the oven or the pita may burn. Check on itâ€” it should puff up and build in color, with some beautiful blistered spots. If itâ€™s still pale, close the oven and let it keep baking for 30- second intervals.
Use tongs to flip the pita, and let it finish baking with the oven door cracked so you can watch it finish. Pull it out when the second side is as pretty as the first; this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your broiler.
Bake off the rest of the dough this way; as you get the hang of it, feel free to bake two pitas at a time.

Place the chopped beets in a large stockpot. Add 10 cups of water and 1 tablespoon vinegar.
Place the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. (If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to cover the pot partially with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid bright red.
Strain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp or reserve. Set aside the beet water. You should have just about 4 cups.
Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 pound of whole beets in a separate large stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender-firm, about 40 minutes. When the beets are cooked, add 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set them aside to cool.
When the whole cooked beets are cool enough to handle, peel them; the skins should slip off easily. Grate the peeled beets on the largest holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the grating blade.
To make the broth, place the pork butt in a large stockpot and add the beef stock. If necessary, add a little more stock or water to cover. Add the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart, about 2 hours. Set the pork aside to cool. When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove it from the pot and cut the meat into Â½-inch cubes. Strain the broth and discard the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns.

Drain the beans and kombu and add them to a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 in. (if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh.
Remove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables.

Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic.
Thinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar.
To serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day itâ€™s made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh.
This works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water youâ€™re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you donâ€™t have an airlock, youâ€™ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60Â°F to 68Â°F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks.

Make the crust: Crumble the crackers and cookies into a medium bowl. Use a pestle or the bottom of a heavy bottle to crush them into fine crumbs. Add â…“ cup (75 ml) of the condensed milk and stir until very well combined. (You can grind the crumbled graham crackers and mix them with the condensed milk in a food processor if you prefer.) Press the crumb mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake until the crust looks a little darker and smells sweet and toasty, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the crust in the pan on a wire rack.
One at a time, cut an avocado in half lengthwise. Twist the halves to separate them. Hold the half with the pit in one hand. Holding the knife in your other hand, rap the knife blade into the pit to lodge it there. Twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit. Use a large spoon to scoop the avocado flesh onto a chopping board, discarding the skins. Coarsely chop the avocados.
Add the chopped avocados, cream cheese, remaining condensed milk, and salt to a food processor. (You can combine the filling in a blender instead but you may need to work in batches.) Grate the zest of 1 lemon and set aside. Squeeze the zested lemon and the limes (you should have about â…“ cup/75 ml lemon), reserving the remaining lemon for garnish. Add the juice to the avocados and process the mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
Spread the filling in the cooled crust and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest. Cover the pan and freeze until the filling is firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.

In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the garlic and use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture constantly until the butter begins to brown and have a slight nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Give the mixture a good stir, and then set it aside to infuse for about 5 minutes longer away from the heat.
Pour the butter mixture (scraping the garlic, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes) all over the warm pasta. If the pasta feels a bit dry, add a touch of the reserved cooking liquid. Toss to combine and set aside.
Set the same skillet (without cleaning it) over medium-high heat. Add the chard stems and cook for 5 minutes. Add the chard leaves and continue to cook, tossing the mixture every so often, until the greens begin to wilt and turn bright green, 3 to 5 minutes longer.

Heat 2 inches vegetable oil in a large, deep pan or wok over medium-high heat until it reaches about 340Â°F, 8 to 10 minutes. If you donâ€™t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a tip of a chicken piece into the oil. If it bubbles, itâ€™s ready. Carefully add the chicken to the oil one piece at a time, working in batches to avoid overcrowding.
Deep-fry, turning the chicken with tongs, until all sides are light golden brown and crunchy, 10 to 12 minutes. As each piece is done, transfer it to the strainer. Once the chicken has drained, transfer it to a large bowl. Repeat with the rest of the chicken, making sure to bring the oil back up to 340Â°F between batches.

Remove the lid, set the pot over high heat, and heat until the surface of the water begins to ripple; pay attention, and do not let it come to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer (the ideal temperature is a few degrees below a light boil) and simmer for 80 to 90 minutes. Taste the dashi every 20 minutes to monitor the changes in flavor and texture. You will notice the texture becoming softer. I describe it as having a slippery, slightly viscous texture compared to tap water. The sea flavor will become stronger, and the dashi will become darker, like pale Earl Grey tea. The sweetness will take a while to appear, but when it does, the dashi is almost ready. When you can taste the sweetness and deep sea flavors, and the dashi has a very soft texture, it is done. Be vigilant, because dashi will become bitter if cooked too long.
Strain the dashi into a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. After 24 hours, the dashi will begin to lose some of its flavor and it will turn slightly flat.
Itâ€™s best to use dashi the same day you make it, though if you keep it refrigerated, you can use it for another day or two. By the third day, it will no longer taste fresh.

Put the tamarind pulp in a heat-proof nonreactive bowl, and cover with the boiling water. Cover and let sit for about 1 hour, until the pulp has become soft and mushy.

Refrigerate the tamarind extract in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, for up to 4 days.
Rinse the ginger and gently scrub to remove any traces of dirt. If the ginger is young, with a thin skin, leave the skin on. Otherwise, peel. Cut into thin slices. In a medium saucepan, combine the ginger, sugar, and remaining 1 cup (240 ml) water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and immediately remove the saucepan from the heat.

Sumac is rich in citric, malic, and tartaric acids but also bitter tannins. Steeping it in water dissolves the water-soluble acids. Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter.

100,Stuffed Eggplants and Zucchini in a Rich Tomato Sauce (Baatingan w Kusaa Bil Banadoura),"['2Â½ tbsp olive oil', '2 onions, finely diced (2Â½ cups/350g)', '4 cups/1kg tomato puree', '12Â¼ oz/350g ripe tomatoes (2 large), coarsely grated', '3Â¼ cups/750ml chicken stock or water', '1 tbsp sugar', 'Salt and black pepper', 'Â¾ cup plus 2 tbsp/175g Egyptian rice or arborio rice (see note below)', '9 oz/250g ground lamb', 'Â¼ cup/60ml olive oil', 'Â½ tsp ground cinnamon', 'Â¾ tsp ground allspice', 'Â½ tsp ground cumin', 'About 3 green onions, finely sliced (â…“ cup/35g)', 'Â¾ cup/15g mint leaves, roughly chopped', 'Â¾ cup/15g parsley leaves, roughly chopped', '1 cup/20g dill, roughly chopped', '1 red chile, seeded and finely diced (1 tbsp/10g)', '1 lemon: finely grate the zest to get 1 tsp', '3 tbsp water', '1Â½ lb/700g eggplants (between 3 and 6, depending on size)', '1Â½ lb/700g zucchini (between 3 and 6, depending on size)', '7 tbsp/100ml olive oil', '6 garlic cloves, finely chopped', '1 tbsp coriander seeds, lightly crushed in a mortar and pestle', '1 red chile, seeded and finely diced (1 tbsp/10g)', 'Â¼ cup/5g parsley leaves, roughly chopped', 'Â¼ cup/5g mint leaves, roughly torn', 'Â¼ cup/5g dill leaves', '1 green onion, thinly sliced (2 tbsp/10g)', '1 cup/250g Greek yogurt']","To make the sauce, put the oil into a saucepan or casserole pan with a lidâ€”about 10 inches/25cm wideâ€”and place over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and caramelized. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients, along with 2Â½ tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, then remove from the heat and set aside.
To make the stuffing, while the sauce is cooking, place all the ingredients in a large bowl with 1Â½ tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well, using your hands to make sure that everything is well incorporated. If making in advance, keep in the fridge until ready to use.
Trim the stalks from the eggplants, then insert a manakra (or peeler or corer) into the eggplant; you want it to be very close to the skinâ€”about â…› inch/3mm awayâ€”but not so close that it tears and wonâ€™t hold its shape when itâ€™s stuffed. Scoop out the flesh to create a generous cavity. You donâ€™t need the flesh anymore, but keep it for another recipe; it can be cut into cubes and steamed or added to your next omelette. If your eggplants are particularly large, slice them in half, crosswise, and scoop out the flesh using a regular small serrated knifeâ€”be sure to keep one end of each half intact, so that the stuffing does not fall out!
Use the manakra or a swivel peeler to scoop out the zucchini flesh. Keep about â…› inch/3mm of flesh attached to the skin inside the zucchini and about Â½ inch/1cm from the end intactâ€”they need to be robust enough to keep the stuffing inside. Again, keep the scooped-out flesh to use elsewhere.
Using your hands, so that you can push in a bit of stuffing at a time, fill all the eggplant and zucchini cavities. Stop filling them about Â½ inch/1cm from the top of each vegetable; the stuffing needs some space to expand inside the vegetables when they are cooking.
Gently lower the stuffed vegetables into the sauce. They wonâ€™t fit in a single layer, but try to avoid too much overlap and submerge them in the sauce as much as you can. Return the sauce to medium heat and, once simmering, decrease the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, or until the rice is completely cooked through and softâ€”test if it is ready by sticking a knife into the middle of one of the vegetables; it should go in very easily. Donâ€™t worry if some of the rice/stuffing spills into the tomato sauce, this can happen and it will be fine when served.
To make the adha, meanwhile, put the oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. After about 1 minute, add the garlic and decrease the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring very often, until the garlic is golden and crispy. Keep a close eye on the pan here; you donâ€™t want the oil to get too hot and for the garlic to burn. Reserving the oil as you pour, strain the garlic through a sieve. Set the garlic asideâ€”it will crisp up as it cools downâ€”and return the oil to the pan. Add the coriander seeds and chile and cook for about 1 minute, stirring a few times, until fragrant. Remove from the heat, transfer to a separate bowl, and set aside until needed.
When the vegetables are cooked and the sauce is thick and rich (but still pourable), use a slotted spoon to carefully lift the vegetables out of the pan. Pour the sauce onto a large serving platter (or individual serving plates) with a rim and top with the stuffed vegetables. Spoon on the adhaâ€”the coriander-chile oil first, followed by the fried garlicâ€”then sprinkle with the fresh herbs and green onion.

Stir, then drain through a colander, squeezing out most of the moisture from the bread. (If using grated zucchini, toss it with Â½ tsp of salt and place in a sieve set over a bowl. Let to sit for 20 minutes, then use your hands to squeeze out as much liquid as possible.)
Transfer the crumbs to a large bowl with the chicken, garlic, spices, herbs, lemon zest, Â¾ tsp salt, and plenty of black pepper. Using well-oiled hands, shape into about 30 small balls; roughly a scant 1 oz/25g each.

Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until fruit is softened and juices deepen in color, about 8 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl, pushing plum flesh through; discard skins. Return sauce to pan and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook, still stirring, until reduced to about â…” cup, about 3 minutes. Pour ripple into a jar and let cool, then cover and chill 1 hour before using.
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350Â°F. Place walnuts on 1 side of a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Toast, tossing halfway through, 8 minutes (nuts should not be quiet golden brown yet). Remove from oven and add sesame seeds on empty side of baking sheet. Toast until nuts and seeds are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Let cool; chop nuts. Combine nuts, sesame seeds, maple syrup, and salt in a small jar or bowl and stir well. Cover and set aside.
Lightly butter pan and line with a parchment paper round. Heat brown sugar, tahini, and remaining Â½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter until bubbling in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, 1 minute. Let cool slightly.
Stir vanilla bean paste and salt followed by egg into brown sugar mixture. Sift flour and baking powder through a fine-mesh sieve into mixture and fold to barely combine. Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Bake until golden around the edges, evenly tan across the top, and puffed in the center, about 20 minutes.
Transfer pan to a wire rack and let blondie base cool. Run a knife around the sides to help base release but keep springform pan intact, then cover and chill in freezer at least 15 minutes or until ready to use.
Cut 3 pints of ice cream out of their containers and place in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, you can beat in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or stiff rubber spatula until the consistency of cake batter.) Mix on low speed 2 minutes, then working up to medium speed, beat until barely pliable. It will soften further as it sits, but you want it to be sticky and slightly challenging to spread when you assemble cake. Chill in the freezer at any point if it becomes too soft and melted.
Remove blondie base and remaining 2 still-frozen pints of ice cream from freezer. Using an offset spatula, spread a third of softened ice cream over base. Using a spring-loaded ice cream scoop, scoop out and place mounds of 1-pint still-frozen ice cream on top in a random manner. Dollop one third of maple ripple over ice cream, avoiding edges of pan. Next, drizzle one third of plum ripple over ice cream, creating stripes. Repeat layering process, using half of remaining softened ice cream, all of remaining frozen ice cream, half of remaining maple ripple, and half of remaining plum ripple. Top with a final layer of remaining softened ice cream, smooth surface, then drizzle with remaining maple ripple and plum ripple. (If at any point the ice cream gets so soft that you canâ€™t achieve distinct layers, chill in freezer for a few minutes.) Freeze, uncovered, 2 hours, then cover and freeze at least 8 hours before serving.

Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool; coarsely grind. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in oregano. Place pork on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and rub with oil. Season all over with 1 Tbsp. salt, then rub with spice mixture, packing it on. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours or chill, uncovered, up to 2 days.
Bring chiles, vinegar, butter, and sugar to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and sauce is reduced by about a third, about 5 minutes. Season with salt; cover and keep warm over low heat until ready to use.
Prepare a grill for medium heat. Drizzle pork all over with oil, then grill, turning every 5 minutes or so, until extremely, gorgeously browned and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 120Â°F, 35â€“45 minutes. Continue to grill, brushing with sauce and turning not quite every minute (youâ€™re going to see flare-ups, but donâ€™t worry), until pork is glazed and shiny and temperature on thermometer has risen to 130Â°F, 5â€“10 minutes more. Transfer pork to a platter and let rest 30 minutes; reserve remaining sauce.
Transfer pork to a cutting board and pour any accumulated juices on platter into reserved sauce. Return sauce to a simmer. Slice pork against the grain Â¼"" thick. Arrange on platter, spoon some sauce over, and season with salt. Serve remaining sauce alongside.

To make the cake, combine the egg yolks, cassava, macapuno (or shredded coconut, if using), coconut milk and the Â½ cup sweetened condensed milk in a large bowl and mix well.
Pour the cake batter into a greased 8 x 8-in (20 x 20-cm) cake pan. The cake batter will appear to be very loose and wet at this point, but donâ€™t worry, the cassava will absorb most of the liquid during baking. Place the cake pan into the oven and bake until the top of the cake appears dry and no liquid is floating on the surface, 45â€“60 minutes.
Meanwhile, to make the topping, whisk together the egg whites and the Â¼ cup (65 ml) sweetened condensed milk in a medium bowl until very well incorporated. Although you are using egg whites, donâ€™t be concerned with making a foam or a meringue, just mix until combined.
Remove the cake from the oven and evenly pour the topping onto the cake. Return the cake to the oven and bake until the topping sets, about 10 minutes more.

Put the peaches in a 9-by-13-inch (or similar) baking pan or gratin dish. Pat the peaches into a roughly even layer, then, using a zester or a Microplane, zest the lemon evenly over the fruit and squeeze the lemon juice evenly over the top.
In the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1Â½ cups of the sugar on medium speed until sandy, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and beat again for another 30 seconds, until all the flour is incorporated and the mixture is evenly crumbly. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in the milk. Increase the speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Plop the batter in 6 large blobs over the top of the peaches. With an offset spatula or small knife, carefully spread the batter evenly over the fruit, so itâ€™s no more than about Â½ inch thick in any one place.
Sprinkle the remaining Â½ cup sugar directly over the batter. Drizzle the hot water evenly over the sugar, using it to melt the sugar into the topping. (Use it all. Itâ€™s a strange method, but it works.)
Bake the cobbler for 70 to 80 minutes, or until the top is browned and cracked. (A toothpick inserted into the topping should come out dryâ€”be sure to check in a few places.)

Add the club soda, egg yolk, and garlic and mix gently using a whisk. Do not whisk too much, or extra gluten will form in the batter, making it too thick and doughy. Whisk about 10 times, then let the batter rest for 10 minutes in the freezer so any remaining small clumps of flour can dissolve and blend into the mixture by themselves.
When youâ€™re ready to make the pancakes, line a sheet pan with paper towels and set aside. Fold the scallions into the cold batter.
Set a 10-inch nonstick sautÃ© pan over high heat and add about 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer and just barely smoke, add 1 cup of the scallion batter to the center of the pan. Using a spatula, spread it out to form a 7-inch pancake. (You donâ€™t want the pancake to touch the sides of the pan, or the edges may burn before the center is cooked through.) Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the bottom of the pancake has set. Once it has set, gently slide your spatula under the edges of the pancake and lift them, tilting the pan, so some of the hot oil runs underneath the pancake. Then cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the bottom is a deep golden brown and crisp. You can check the color by gently lifting an edge of the pancake with your spatula. Flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is golden brown on the second side and cooked through. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. Wipe out the pan, set it back over high heat, add another tablespoon or so of oil, and repeat until all of the pancakes are cooked. The finished pancakes can be kept in a low (200Â°F) oven on a clean sheet pan while you cook the remaining batches, but itâ€™s best to eat them right away.

Flash steam firm vegetables like cauliflower and carrots in a colander over boiling water for just a minute or two: the pieces should still be firm. Lay them on a kitchen towel to dry. If using fresh turmeric, cover the chopping board in plastic wrap, and wear gloves. Scrape off the skin with a spoon as you would for ginger and rinse it clean to wash away any tough bits. Pat each fingerling down and slice into thin rounds or to match the ginger, and place on a paper towel to air dry. All vegetables must be dry to touch before pickling. To prepare ginger, peel and slice ginger into eighth-inch-thick slices, and chop them to look like carrot sticks. Spread on a paper towel and set aside to air dry for 15-20 minutes.
If using whole mustard seeds or whole fenugreek seeds, in two separate sets, crush each in a spice mill in short bursts until they each are broken down but not powdered. They should be the consistency of coffee grounds.
Method: Heat the oil in a large, wide mouth saucepan until it is hot but not smoking. Reduce the heat to low. Slowly add all the spices: mustard halves, fenugreek halves, asafetida powder, cayenne pepper if using, along with the serrano pepper if using, and ginger sticks. Add vinegar and salt. Allow this to sizzle for a minute on low. Stir to allow the heat to distribute evenly. When the oil is aromatic, slowly add the trimmed vegetables and stir in well. Turn up the heat and let this cook for 4-5 minutes until vegetables appear to have absorbed the spices a little. Turn off the heat and cover with a paper towel to capture any steam. Allow this to come to room temperature before storing.
To Store: Use smaller (4 â€“ 6 oz.) sanitized and dried glass jars to store the pickle. Using a clean and dry spoon that is smaller than the mouth of the jar, ladle out portions of the pickle into each jar. Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t get the oils or juices when first filling the jars. Fill jars at least a half inch below the rim of the jar. Shake them once to allow the pieces to settle. Divide up any of the liquid over each of these jars, taking care that each jar has some of the spicy sauce. Lightly shake each jar to ensure the liquid finds its way into the nooks and crannies of vegetable pieces. Close the lid and store in the fridge.

Transfer to a large bowl and cover with 4 cups cold water. If your tap water is heavily chlorinated, use filtered water for soaking as chlorine will inhibit fermentation later on.
Pick over dal for debris, then rinse in sieve under cold running water. Transfer to a medium bowl and add fenugreek. Cover with 2 cups cold water (again using filtered if needed). Let rice and dal soak at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours.
Drain rice, holding back grains with your hand and pouring off most of the soaking liquid into a pitcher or large measuring glass. Transfer rice to a blender. Pulse to get things going, then purÃ©e, sparingly adding soaking liquid as needed, until a paste forms (mixture should be foamy and still slightly gritty when rubbed between your fingers). Pour into a clean large bowl. Repeat process with dal mixture, then vigorously stir blended dal into rice paste.
Add reserved soaking liquid as needed to create a pourable batter that falls off the spoon in a steady stream and gradually dissolves into itself. Stir in salt. (If you are in a warm climate, add salt after fermentation to keep batter from becoming overly sour.) Cover bowl with a kitchen towel, then a silicone lid (this will keep the surface of the batter from drying out). Set bowl in a warm spot (a proofing box or an oven with the light on and a bowl of hot water placed inside work well). Let batter sit until airy and pleasantly sour (when you drizzle it from a spoon, it should fall on itself in slowly dissolving ribbons), 4â€“6 hours in a very warm environment and as long as 2 days in a very cool environment. In general, 14 hours is a safe starting point.
Do ahead: Batter can be made 1 week ahead. Once fermented, cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking. Thin with water if needed to reach a thick but pourable consistency.
Heat 2 tsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add green chiles and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and any juices and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes are tender, 7â€“9 minutes. Carefully transfer to clean blender or a food processor and blend until smooth; reserve skillet. Taste chutney and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a small bowl.
Wipe out reserved skillet and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Cook mustard seeds, stirring constantly, until they start to pop, about 30 seconds. Add curry leaves, dried red chile, and dal and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry leaves wilt and crisp and dal is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Mix in asafoetida, if using, and remove spice oil from heat. Mix into chutney.
To cook dosas, heat a griddle or large skillet (the larger the better; you want the batter to have room to spread) over medium. Sprinkle a little water on surface; if it sizzles youâ€™re good to go. (Itâ€™s important though not to let griddle get hotter than medium. If itâ€™s too hot, the batter will start to cook before itâ€™s fully spread out, yielding a thick dosa, or worse, a thin dosa that tears. Adjust heat as needed). Brush griddle with a thin layer of ghee, wiping off excess with a folded paper towel. Ladle a generous â…“-cupful of batter in the center of griddle and use ladle to spread batter, working outward in continuous circles and never lifting ladle off surface, to create an 8""-diameter round. Ridges of thick and thin batter will form naturally. Cook dosa 30 seconds, then drizzle â…› tsp. ghee over batter. For a spongier dosa, cover with a large bowl and steam until cooked through, about 2 minutes (cooked underside should show through thinner spots, and thicker spots should be opaque and bouncy). For a drier dosa, cook until surface is mostly set, about 2 minutes, then, using a fish spatula or other wide spatula, flip dosa over (it should easily lift from the griddle at this point) and cook until second side is lightly golden, about 20 seconds. Fold dosa in half so toasted side is facing out and transfer to a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter and ghee.
Serve dosas as they are ready with chutney alongside for dipping.",homestyle-dosas-with-tomato-chutney,"['2 cups long-grain white rice', 'Â½ cup whole or split urad dal (black gram)', 'Â½ tsp. fenugreek seeds', '1 tsp. kosher salt', '2 tsp. plus 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil', '1 small onion, finely chopped', '2â€“3 small green chiles (such as serrano), seeds removed if desired, finely chopped', '4 small tomatoes or canned whole peeled tomatoes, chopped', 'Kosher salt', '2 tsp. black mustard seeds', '8â€“10 fresh or frozen curry leaves', '1 dried red chile (such as bird or chile de Ã¡rbol)', '1 tsp. split or whole urad dal (black gram)', 'A pinch of asafoetida (optional)', '1 tsp. ghee or clarified butter', 'melted', 'divided', 'plus more for griddle']"

Transfer to a small bowl and let cool. Set aside for serving.
Blend garlic, dill, mint, tahini, and â…“ cup water in a blender or food processor until a thick paste forms. Add lemon juice and blend again, adding an additional 1â€“2 Tbsp. water if sauce is too thick. It should be easily spreadable but not runny. Season with salt and lots of pepper.
Remove outer leaves and trim stem from cauliflower so it sits flat. Cut cauliflower into 4 wedges.
Whisk oil, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and a big pinch of salt in a large bowl to combine. Add cauliflower and coat in oil. The cauliflower can fall apart easily, so handle with care and use your fingers to work oil into the uneven surface.
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat (if using a charcoal grill, bank most of the coals on one side of the grill). Place cauliflower, cut side down, on grate over hottest part of grill and grill, undisturbed, until char marks form, about 3 minutes (you can carefully lift to check, but try not to move too much). Turn over onto other cut side and grill, undisturbed, until grill marks form, about 3 minutes. Turn onto uneven floret side and slide over to cooler part of grill or reduce heat to low and cover with lid. Grill until tender (if a bamboo skewer easily slides through the thickest part, itâ€™s done), 10â€“15 minutes. (And if you donâ€™t have a grill, you can do this in a grill pan over high. Once pan is very hot, add cauliflower, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook both cut sides as above. When you turn cauliflower over onto uneven floret side, reduce heat to low and cover pan with foil to finish cooking.)

Toss shallots, vinegar, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a small bowl to combine; lightly season with salt (the Pecorino will add some saltiness, so bear that in mind). Let sit 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, very thinly slice Pecorino into tiles with a knife (irregular pieces are okay).
Add Pecorino, herbs, and oil to pickled shallots and toss gently to combine. Taste and season with more salt if needed; set aside.
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; clean grate. Working one at a time, set mushrooms on their sides and slice lengthwise Â¼"" thick to make 3â€“4 planks per mushroom, depending their size. If your mushrooms are particularly small or you are using crimini, slice Â½"" thick and thread onto skewers to keep them from falling through grate.
Using some of the oil, brush cut sides of mushrooms and transfer to a large bowl or arrange on a rimmed baking sheet if skewered. Lightly brush both sides of each slice of bread with remaining oil and transfer to a platter.
Press each slice of bread down across grate for even contact and grill until browned with some lightly charred spots, about 2 minutes per side. The goal is a crunchy exterior with a still chewy center. Transfer bread back to platter.
Brush grate to clean. If using a gas grill, turn heat down to medium. A charcoal grill should be at the tail end of medium-high and headed toward medium at this point, but wait a few minutes if needed. Grill mushrooms, turning halfway through and moving around as needed to avoid flare-ups, until golden all over with lightly charred edges, 6â€“8 minutes for small pieces and 8â€“10 minutes for large ones.

Set aside.
With a small, sharp knife, release the edge of the membrane on the back of each rack of ribs. Grasp the edge with needle-nose pliers or a piece of paper towel and peel the membrane off the rack. (If you leave the membrane on, the ribs will be chewy.)
Spread the dry rub all over each rack of ribs until completely coated. Make sure you press the dry rub into the meat. This is where your flavor is going to come from. Arrange the ribs in a rib rack, with all the racks facing the same direction. A rib rack has 8 slab compartments, looks like a rack of coat hangers and can be purchased at most barbecue stores.
Fire up your charcoal grill and prep the grill for cooking over indirect heat. You need a low temperature of around 250 to 300Â°F (120 to 150Â°C) to grill the ribs. For gas grills, preheat the grill to low then turn off one side of the grill to achieve indirect heat. Place a drip tray on the cooler side of the grate and half fill the pan with warm water or the beer of your choice.
Drain 2 chunks of hickory, place them on top of the charcoal and set the grate in place. For gas barbecues, place half of the hickory chips in a foil pouch and place the pouch directly on the heated side of the grill. Wait for the hickory to start to smoke.
Place the rib racks over indirect heat as far from the heat as possible, with the bone sides facing toward the heat. Close the lid and close the top vent on a charcoal grill about halfway. This will maintain a temperature between 250 and 300Â°F (120 and 150Â°C). Cook the ribs for 2 hours.
Once the ribs are on, itâ€™s time to start working on the barbecue sauce. If you have a side burner this can be done outside. If you donâ€™t, go inside and use your stove top to simmer your sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the sauce reaches a glaze consistency. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.
The first batch of charcoal should be cooling down after 2 hours. Now is the time to use your chimney starter and get another batch of charcoal lit. Add the remaining wood chunks to the coals to get a little more smoke. If using a gas grill, wrap the remaining chips in foil and place directly on the hotter side of the grate. Close the lid and grill for another 2 hours. Make sure to come back every hour on the hour to check the temperature and to add more charcoal, if necessary. In the last hour of grilling, your ribs will start to show signs of cooking all the way through. When the meat pulls back from the bone, the ribs are almost ready. Baste the ribs with the barbecue sauce during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking.

175,Roasted Strawberry Layer Cake,"['Scant 2 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour', '2Â½ tsp (11 g) baking powder', '3 tbsp (45 ml) milk', '2 tbsp (30 ml) elderflower cordial', '1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter', '1 cup plus 2 tbsp (230 g) superfine/caster sugar', 'Zest of 1 lemon', '4 eggs', 'Approximately 1 lb (400â€“450 g) fresh strawberries', 'Â¼ cup (50 g) superfine/caster sugar', '2 tsp (10 g) vanilla bean paste', 'Â½ cup plus 1 tbsp (150 g) egg whites', '1 cup (200 g) superfine/caster sugar', '1â…“ cups (300 g) unsalted butter, softened', '6 tbsp (90 ml) elderflower cordial', 'Fresh strawberries, to decorate', 'Fresh elderflower, to decorate']","Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (180Â°C). Grease the base and sides of three deep, round 6-inch (15-cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.
To make the cake, sift together the flour and baking powder in a large bowl, and set aside. Mix the milk and elderflower cordial in a small bowl and set aside. Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest for 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture looks like itâ€™s starting to curdle, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of the flour mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture followed by the milk and elderflower. Stir in the remaining flour and divide the batter equally into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to firm up.
To make the purÃ©e, preheat the oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C). Slice the stems off the strawberries, cut them in half and put them into a baking dish. Toss the fruit with the sugar and vanilla. Roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once halfway. The strawberries are done once they are soft and fragrant and the juices have turned into a syrup. Leave the strawberries to cool completely before transferring them to a food processor or blender and pulsing until smooth. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until youâ€™re ready to use it.
To make the buttercream, add the egg whites and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer or a heatproof bowl. Make sure there are no traces of grease in the bowl as this will stop the meringue from whipping up. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the base doesnâ€™t touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar constantly until the mixture reaches a temperature of about 150Â°F (65Â°C). If you donâ€™t have a thermometer, rub a little of the mixture in between your fingers. The eggs should be hot to the touch with all the sugar dissolved.
Remove the bowl from the heat and start whisking the egg whites on high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with an electric whisk. Beat until the whites are thick and have doubled in volume. Once the bowl is cool to the touch and with the mixer still running, add the butter a piece at a time. The meringue will deflate and will start to look a little runny or curdled. Donâ€™t panicâ€”this is normal. Continue beating until you have added in all of the butter and the mixture is smooth and glossy. If after 10 minutes, your meringue buttercream is still soupy, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes and then beat again. Add about 1/2 cup (125 g) of the strawberry puree and beat the buttercream for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Leave the buttercream at room temperature until you are ready to assemble.
Unwrap the cakes from the fridge and if any of them are domed, level them with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. All the layers need to be completely flat to ensure you donâ€™t end up with a wonky cake. Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of elderflower cordial. Place one layer of cake on a cake board and put this board on a turntable, if using. If your buttercream has firmed up, whip it up again in the mixer until smooth. Add a scoop of buttercream and spread it out evenly with an offset spatula, pushing the buttercream right to the edge (itâ€™s fine if it spills over). Place the next layer on top of the first, but this time add about 1 tablespoon (8 g) of strawberry purÃ©e on top of the buttercream layer, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) clear around the edge. Place the last layer topside down to give you a perfectly flat top.
Frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth the edges as much as you can with a bench scraper or palette knife. This is the crumb coat layer that will trap any stray crumbs and act as a base for the next layer. Place the cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up before adding another layer of buttercream on the top and sides. Fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle (Iâ€™ve used Wilton 8B) with any remaining buttercream and pipe swirls across the edge to make a wreath. Top the cake with fresh strawberries, a drizzle of any leftover puree and fresh elderflower (if in season).",roasted-strawberry-layer-cake-new-way-to-cake,"['Scant 2 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour', '2Â½ tsp (11 g) baking powder', '3 tbsp (45 ml) milk', '2 tbsp (30 ml) elderflower cordial', '1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter', '1 cup plus 2 tbsp (230 g) superfine/caster sugar', 'Zest of 1 lemon', '4 eggs', 'Approximately 1 lb (400â€“450 g) fresh strawberries', 'Â¼ cup (50 g) superfine/caster sugar', '2 tsp (10 g) vanilla bean paste', 'Â½ cup plus 1 tbsp (150 g) egg whites', '1 cup (200 g) superfine/caster sugar', '1â…“ cups (300 g) unsalted butter, softened', '6 tbsp (90 ml) elderflower cordial', 'Fresh strawberries, to decorate', 'Fresh elderflower', 'to decorate']"

Let sit until mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.
Add whole wheat flour, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil to yeast mixture and mix to combine. Fit mixer with dough hook and, with mixer on low speed, gradually add 3 cups (375 g) bread flour, mixing until a shaggy dough forms, about 4 minutes from when you start adding the flour. Stop mixer and scrape down sides of bowl to incorporate any dry bits into dough. Increase mixer speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and shiny, about 5 minutes.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly to bring together. Shape into a ball, place in a large lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat. Cover bowl and let dough sit in warm draft-free spot until doubled in size, 1â€“1Â½ hours. Make your toppings while your dough is rising.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until skins start to blister and split, about 2 minutes.

Prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Clean grate. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 pieces. Working one at a time, gently shape into balls. Transfer to a lightly floured small rimmed baking sheet and cover. Let sit 20â€“30 minutes.
Place a ball of dough on a lightly floured surface (keep remaining balls covered) and, using your fingers, press out to an 8"" round. Drape dough over the backs of your hands and gently pull and stretch, rotating dough as you go, until about 12"" in diameter (itâ€™s okay if itâ€™s not a perfect circle).
Brush dough with oil. Place, oiled side down, on grill over direct heat and cook until large bubbles appear across surface, dough stiffens, and underside is dark brown, about 2 minutes. Brush top with oil, turn over, and cook just to lightly dry out second side, about 30 seconds.
Using tongs and a metal spatula, move dough over to cooler side of grill. Top with a spoonful of passata or burst cherry tomatoes and one quarter of cheese (either alone or in combination). Add pepperoni or salami (if using), then some of the lemony Swiss chard, and/or Rosemary Agrodolce as desired. Carefully slide pizza back over direct heat. Cook until cheese is melted and toppings are heated through, about 2 minutes. If dough is in danger of burning on underside but toppings need more time, return pizza to cooler side, cover grill, and cook another 1â€“2 minutes.

(Alternatively, you can heat in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.)
Whisk egg, brown sugar, and yeast in a liquid measuring cup to combine, then whisk into buttermilk mixture.
Pulse flour, baking soda, and salt in a food processor to combine. With the motor running, stream in buttermilk mixture. Process until about 80% of the dough comes together into a ball (mixture will look very wet at first, then begin to pull away from the sides of processor), about 2 minutes.
Using a bowl scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough onto an unfloured surface. (It should still be pretty wet and sticky.) Knead, pushing it away from you, then pulling it back toward you, until a smooth ball forms, about 3 minutes. The dough will grow silkier, tighter, and easier to work with as you knead.
Roll out dough into a rough 8"" square. Fold dough over onto itself to make an 8x4"" rectangle, then flatten it slightly and fold over once more to make a 4"" square. Roll dough back out to an 8"" square and repeat folding process (you should be back at a 4"" square). Pour remaining 1 Tbsp. oil into a medium bowl and add dough (still folded); turn to coat. Cover bowl tightly and chill dough until doubled in volume, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.
Place dates in a small bowl and pour in 1Â½ cups hot water to cover. Let soak until softened, about 10 minutes.
Drain dates and transfer to a food processor; discard soaking liquid. Add cinnamon, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil. PurÃ©e, scraping down sides as needed, until smooth, about 4 minutes. (You should have about Â½ cup purÃ©e.)
Grease a 10"" cast-iron skillet with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Transfer dough to a clean, unfloured surface and roll out to an 8"" square. Fold in half into an 8x4"" rectangle, then fold rectangle over itself to form a 4"" square (same folding process as you did before). If dough feels tough and uncooperative, let it sit about 5 minutes to relax and try again. Roll out dough to a 12"" square about Â¼"" thick. Dollop date purÃ©e all over. Using a small offset spatula, spread evenly over dough, leaving a Â½"" border without purÃ©e along edge farthest from you. Sprinkle brown sugar over purÃ©e.
Starting at edge closest to you, roll up dough into a tight log. Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim about Â½"" of dough from both ends and discard. Slice log crosswise into 3 sections, wiping knife clean between slices. Slice each section crosswise into 3 buns (you should have 9 buns total that are each about 1"" thick). Transfer buns to prepared pan as you go.
Cover pan tightly with foil (or a domed lid if you have one) and place in a warm, dry spot. Let buns rise until theyâ€™re doubled in volume and spring back when poked, leaving only a small indentation, 1â€“1Â½ hours, depending on how warm and humid your kitchen is.
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350Â°F. Bake buns, still covered, until puffed, pale, and mostly set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes if you prefer a soft and squishy bun and up to 25 minutes for a more toasted bun. Let cool slightly.
Meanwhile, whisk powdered sugar, buttermilk, and vanilla in a medium bowl to combine.
Brush glaze over warm buns and serve in skillet.

Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Working quickly and using a rolling pin and your hands, press dough together to form a mass. Roll dough into a rough square about Â½"" thick. Fold in half into a rectangle, then once again to make a small square. Press down on the dough with rolling pin to make it hold together. Roll dough out once more to make a rough square about Â½"" thick. Repeat folding process, taking your time to make it neat as this will be your final fold. Using rolling pin, gently flatten dough, rotating as needed, to make a 6""-diameter disk.
Dust surface with more flour and roll disk into a 14""-diameter circle or oval about â…›"" thick. Fold dough in half, then in half again to make a rough triangle (this will make it easier to move). Slide onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and unfold. Chill while you make the filling.
Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Wrap 6"" disk tightly and chill until ready to roll out.
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375Â°F. Heat 3 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium until foaming, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low; add onion, garlic, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or Â½ tsp. Morton salt, and stir to combine. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender and just beginning to brown, 6â€“8 minutes.

Generously butter a 13x9"" baking pan (for thicker focaccia thatâ€™s perfect for sandwiches) or an 18x13"" rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1 Tbsp. oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (Using a fork in each hand makes this process even easier and less messy!)
Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over the dough and coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot until doubled in size, at least 1Â½ hours and up to 4 hours. To see if itâ€™s ready, poke the dough with your finger. The dough should spring back slowly, leaving a small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isnâ€™t ready.
